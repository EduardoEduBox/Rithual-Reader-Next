## Everything begins with data

​

- What is the data you can access or get?
  ​ - User input - Seed in - API
  ​
- What assets do you need and from where to get it? - Images (e.g. Unsplash) - Videos (e.g. Pexels) - Audio (e.g. FreeSound) - Game assets (e.g. OpenGameArt, itch.io)
  ​

## User stories / User scenarios

​

- What are the user stories? - General explanation of a software feature from the perspective of a user - The purpose of a user story is how a piece of work will deliver value to the user - Example:
  ​
  **As a** user,
  **I want to** be able to search for a specific movie
  **so that I** can see the details of the movie.
  ​
- User scenarios - A user scenario is a description of a user's interaction with a system - Example:
  ​
  Title: Search for a movie
  ​
  **Given** I am on the home page
  **When** I search for a movie
  **Then** I should see the details of the movie
  ​

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

​
Once you have written all of your user stories, decide which features will be part of the MVP.
​

> Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.
> ​
> **The most dangerous question is: What if...**
> ​
> Think about Interview Scheduler project. We could have added a lot of features to it, but we decided to keep it simple and focus on the core functionality.
> ​
> Some features that we could have added:
> ​

- Add option to multiple interviews per appointment
- Add option to access upcoming weeks
- Add user authentication
- Add interviewer profiles (update availability)
  ​

## Tech choices

​

- What technologies will you use? - Libraries - Bootstrap - SASS - Axios - Redux - Moment - Storybook - Twilio - Etc... - Front-end - React - Vue - Angular - Back-end - Node - Ruby on Rails - Django - Database - Firebase / AWS / Azure - PostgreSQL - MySQL - MongoDB

##### NEXT.JS, FIREBASE AUTH, FIRESTORE DB, TAILWIND CSS, AXIOS (requests), TYPESCRIPT ​

## ERD

​

- Entities are nouns. Identify the nouns in your user stories.
  - Example:
    As a **user**,
    I want to be able to search for a specific **chapter**
- Columns are attributes. Identify the attributes of each noun.
- Identify the entities and relationships:
  - One to many
  - Many to many (create a join table)
- Draw the ERD
  ​

## Wireframes

​

> Wireframes are low-fidelity, black and white, sketches of the user interface. They are used to plan the layout of the user interface.

#### on progress!

- Draw the wireframes
  ​

## Design

​
You came to this program to learn how to be a developer, not a designer. However, it is important to have a good design. You can use a tool like Figma to create your design.
​
You can get an inspiration from the following websites:
​

- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
- [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
- [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ca/)
- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
- [CSS Design Awards](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/)
  ​
  **Cool idea:** Try to talk to UI/UX students and ask them to help you with the design.
  ​
  Would be a great opportunity for you to pratice your communication skills and technical skills for them.
  ​

## Workflows

​

### Git

​

- Never code on master
  #### yes sir!
- Never force push master
  #### yes sir!
- Merge conflicts happens. There are ways of minimizing them but you can neve get rid of them completely.
